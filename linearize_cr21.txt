1. Setup a restriction digest reaction:

    Reagent                Conc      Vol
    ────────────────────────────────────
    pCR21 DNA        ≈500 ng/μL  43.5 μL
    CutSmart buffer        10 x   5.0 μL
    XmnI                20 U/μL   1.5 μL

    (approximately 1U XmnI per 1 μg DNA)

2. Incubate at 37°C for 2h, then 65°C for 20 min (to 
   heat-inactivate the enzyme).

3. Purify the DNA using a PCR cleanup kit.  You can 
   also do a gel extraction if you want to be extra 
   sure that the DNA is clean (and you don't mind the 
   potential yield hit).  
   
   If you're doing a large scale prep (e.g. 1 mL), 
   you can't do a PCR cleanup because you'll exceed
   the 10 μg capacity of the spin columns.  Instead, 
   either do an ethanol precipitation or a miraprep- 
   style PCR cleanup.

4. Measure the concentration on the nanodrop and 
   dilute to 30 nM.
