sgRNA sensor project files
==========================
This directory contains all the files for the sgRNA sensor project.  Below is a 
brief description of each directory:

data/
   Miscellaneous data files, organized by type (e.g. gels, sequencing, flow 
   cytometry, etc.)

analysis/
   Python code for generating the sequences associated with all the various 
   design names I use (e.g. rxb/11/1 => GUUUCA...)

documents/
   Group meetings, presentations, manuscripts, etc.

flow_cytometry/ (git repository)
   Scripts for analyzing flow cytometry data.

literature/
   An out-of-date set of papers relevant to this project.  I now keep my papers 
   in a Zotero database that's not accessible from the file server.

orders/
   Quotes for various things I've ordered.  Not really useful for anything.

protocols/
   Protocols relevant to this project, including the in vitro cleavage assay, 
   electocompetent cell preps, and library screening.  Does not include 
   protocols that are generally useful for every project I work on.

scripts/
   Generally useful scripts, for tasks such as designing cloning primers, 
   quantifying the efficiency of electrocompetent transformations, and tracking 
   the progress library screens.

sequences/
   Snapgene files for all the plasmids that are being used in this project.

structures/
   Pymol sessions for the Cas9/sgRNA complex, which are sometimes useful to 
   look at.

notebook/
   Plans and results for specific experiments, such as cloning and screening 
   libraries.
