Before starting
===============
- Make sure there are 10 μg of DNA

- Make sure that your PEG is < 3 months old.

- Make sure there is sterile water in the deli fridge

- If you're using plates, make them a day ahead

Grow to Midlog
==============
- Inoculate 5 mL YPD culture. Grow overnight 30°C 
  shaking.
        
  DO NOT USE CARMELIZED YPD.

- In the morning, dilute a new culture to OD600 ~0.2 
  into 50 mL YPD. Usually 1 mL saturated culture. 
  Grow to OD=1.0. Should be 4-6 hours.

  I have had this take longer, like ~8h. Just check 
  the OD frequently.

Prepare ssDNA, water baths, and DNA
===================================
- Get an ice bucket.

- Start the water bath, set to 42°C.

- Set the centrifuge to 4°C.

- If doing an integration, linearize DNA by cutting 
  for 1h (30 min is ok if you're in a hurry).

- Take ssDNA (2 aliquots) out of the freezer, thaw 
  them, and then boil them at 100°C for 5 min. Then 
  cool on ice.

Wash and Resuspend in Lithium Acetate
=====================================
- Pellet cells 3000 rpm (2000g) for 5 min in 50 mL 
  conicals (don't fill past 35 mL!)

- Discard supernatant -- pour decently quickly 
  because cells not well pelleted.

- Wash with equal volume cold sterile water.

- Pellet again at 3000 rpm (2000g) for 5 min. Discard 
  supernatant -- (same thing).

- Resuspend in 5 mL 100 mM lithium acetate.

- Pellet again at 3000 rpm (2000g) for 5 min. Discard 
  supernatant -- (same thing).

Transformation Mix Prep
=======================
- Resuspend pellet in 500 μL cold, sterile water & 
  vortexing

  I find that pouring off the 100mM LiOAc usually 
  leaves ~280 μL behind, so I just add 220 μL

- Add 2.4mL PEG, vortex

- Add 360uL 1M LiOAc, vortex

- Add your DNA to 500 μL reboiled ssDNA, vortex to 
  mix, then pipette onto cells & vortex.

Heat Shock
==========
- Vortex tubes enough to homogenize everything.

- Pre-incubate at 30°C with shaking for 30 min.

- Heat shock in 42°C water bath for 45 min.

Wash and Plate
==============
- Pellet at 3000 rpm (2000g) for 5min. Discard 
  supernatant -- (same thing).

- Gently resuspend in in the volume you want to 
  plate, ≈975uL water (pellet will be ~35uL)

- Use 10uL for a titering plate, then do a dilution 
  series using 5uL into 45uL sterile water. Spot 3uL 
  onto selective plate.

- Plate or pour the remaining transformation (should 
  be ~1mL) into selective media (50mL or library 
  plate)

- Yeast take 36-48 hrs to grow on a plate.

Troubleshooting
===============
Some things that you could try to make 
transformations/integrations work better:

    YPD rescue for 1 hr after your transformation.
    Use warm YPD and plates.
    Use/keep the pellet and all reagents ice cold 
    before incubation and heat shock.
    Freshly boiling the ssDNA.
    Making fresh PEG.
    Adding PEG on top of the pellet instead of 
    resuspending the pellet in water.
