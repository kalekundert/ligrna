    "3. Transform pAN068 (KanR) into Top10 cells.  Also transform pAN045, just to have more of it.  My plan is to try the mira-prep protocol.  I got ~2.5 uL plasmid (from Andrew), and I used 1 uL for this transformation.  I used 20 uL of CaCl2 competent Top10 cells, and recovered in 100 uL SOC for 3h (I meant to recover for 1h, but I forgot about it).  I plated 100 uL SOC on pre-warmed Kan plates.\n",

    "1. Both transformations were lawns.  I decided to start 50 mL day cultures from the lawns (with the goal of miniprepping them and maybe even attempting the yeast transformation).  I prepared 2 flasks with 50 mL LB+Kan.  Then I pipeted 500 uL LB+Kan onto each plate and used a sterile innoculating rod to suspend about 1/6 of the cells in the media.  I then aspirated as much of this media as I could (about 300 uL) and dispensed it into the appropriate flask.  I put the flasks in the 37C shaker and let them grow for 8h.\n",

    "2. I isolated plasmid DNA for both cultures using the mira-prep protocol:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Pellet 50 mL cells by spinning at 3500g for 10 min on the tabletop centrifuge.  The supernatant still seemed cloudy after 10 min (although there was a clear pellet), so I spun for another 10 min.  The supernatant was still cloudy after that, but I decided to move on to the next step.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Resuspend, lyse, and neutralize the cells as in a usual miniprep, but use 2 mL of each buffer.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Distribute the lysed cells between 4 1.5 mL tubes by pouring (not pipeting) and spin at 13,200g for 10 min.  (This is only about 75% as fast as I usually spin, I don't know if the difference really matters.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Collect the supernatants into a single 15 mL tube and add 1 volume of 100% ethanol.  Invert to mix a few times.  The solution should become very slightly cloudy.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Run the DNA/ethanol mixture through a single miniprep spin column using a vacuum manifold.  This got slower and slower as more precipitated DNA clogged the filter, so eventually I had to switch to using the centrifuge.  The mira-prep paper suggests using 5 spin columns (each of which only has ~2 mL passed through it), but this dilutes the resulting DNA 5 times.  For transformations, I want the highest possible concentration.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Wash twice with 500 uL PE, then elute with 50 uL EB.  In the future, I could try eluting with 30 uL EB for higher concentrations.\n",

    "1. Measue the OD of the overnight culture using the nanodrop: 1.68\n",

    "   That might be outside the linear range of the nanodrop.  Andrew says YPD supports growth up to OD600 = 20, so the overnight should be higher than 2.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Dilute 500 uL overnight into 50 mL culture.  The protocol says to dilute to OD600=0.2, but I'm behind schedule and it would take too long to make a serial dilution to get into the linear range of the nanodrop to really confirm my OD, and I'm sure a 1:100 dilution is good enough.\n",

We have 20 U/uL NotI-HF (one unit is defined as the amount of enzyme required to digest 1 μg of pBC4 DNA in 1 hour at 37°C in a total reaction volume of 50 μl).  The protocol doesn't specify how much DNA to use, so I just decided to use 10 uL; that's still an extreme amount of DNA, but I'll still have enough to try again if I need to.  10 uL is 32 ug, which means I'll need 1.5 uL NotI-HF.\n",

    "   Oh wait, I just realized that the protocol did specify 10 ug of DNA.  So I guess I linearized 3x more than I should've.  I'm going to use exactly 10 ug for the transformation, because I think the amount of plasmid DNA and the amount of ssDNA are correlated.\n",

    "8. After 7h20 of growth, I tried diluting the yeast by adding an equal part water before measuring OD, and I measured an OD of 0.5587, which corresponds to an actual OD of 1.117.  A few minutes earlier, I'd measured their OD to be .8385 without diluting.  I'm not really sure what the actual OD600 was.  Maybe I made a mistake doing the dilution (scratched a cuvette, didn't mix well enough, had a bubble, something), or maybe OD600 1.0 is already outside of the linear range for the spectrophotometer.  In any case, I should think about ways to track the OD600 more reliably next time.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. I tried denaturing the ssDNA in a hot plate set to 100C, but that didn't work very well.  I had a hard time keeping the temperature near 100C, and the water I put in the well kept evaporating and leaving the tube dry.  Plus whenever I added water, that probably dropped the temperature below 100C for a while.  Maybe next time I should split the ssDNA into smaller aliquots and use the thermocycler.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. After suspending the cells in 5 mL LiOAc, I should probably switch to a smaller tube, either a 15 mL culture tube or a 15 mL falcon tube.  This time I just kept everything in the 50 mL tube, and it didn't vortex very well.\n",
