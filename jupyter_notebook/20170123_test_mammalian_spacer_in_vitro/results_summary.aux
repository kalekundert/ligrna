\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces Results from the \emph  {in vitro} Cas9 cleavage experiment with our inducible sgRNAs in the context of four different spacers. The ``on'' and ``off'' constructs are the positive and negative controls, respectively. The negative control has two mutations in the nexus domain that render it non-functional. The dark blue bars represent the ``gfp'' spacer we use in our bacterial CRISPRi assay. All three of our designs work well with this spacer in that assay. The light blue bars represent the three spacers you gave us to test. Each is labeled by its first three nucleotides. ``CCG'' is the spacer that's already been tested in mammalian cells; ``CAG'' and ``CCT'' are the two that haven't. The grey axis on the right corresponds to the arrows. The tail of each arrow shows what percent of the DNA was cleaved without theophylline, and the head shows what percent was cleaved with.}}{1}}

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces Raw data from the \emph  {in vitro} Cas9 cleavage experiment. Each reaction contained 30\,nM Cas9, 150\,nM \emph  {in vitro} transcribed sgRNA, 3\,nM target DNA, and either water (in the lanes labeled ``-'') or 10\,mM theophylline (in the lanes labeled ``+''). The reactions were incubated at 37\ensuremath  {^\circ }{}C for 1\,h, then quenched by the addition of RNase\nobreakspace  {}A and proteinase\nobreakspace  {}K. The target DNA is 4\,kb and the cleavage site is roughly in the middle, so the 4\,kb and 2\,kb bands are the uncleaved and cleaved DNA respectively.}}{2}}
