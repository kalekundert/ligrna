I didn't find any sensors in this library, and I'm attributing that to the 
weakness of the ammeline aptamer.

The library prep was easily my best yet.  Both transformations worked well and 
I ended up with over 97% of the library in cells.  Furthermore, I was able to 
sort 90% of the library in my first screen, which is as close to full coverage 
as I've ever gotten.

I know that the ammeline aptamer works, because I transplanted it onto rxb/11/1 
and saw it work (weakly).  So I can't attribute my failure to find anything to 
ammeline not getting in the cells, or accidentally entering the wrong ammeline 
sequence, or anything like that.

I don't believe that there's a compatibility problem between the ammeline 
aptamer and the hairpin stem, which was evolved for theophylline from the rhf 
library.  It may be that the stem needs to make sequence-specific interactions 
with the aptamer, or that the stem has to be shorter if the aptamer is weaker, 
but the qh library specifically randomized the stem and also came up empty.

There may be other factors I'm not considering, but I think the aptamer is not 
capable of fold-changes in signal much larger than the 2x I observed with 
rxb/11/1, and that I didn't draw my gates loosely enough to catch such weak 
designs.

Also: The fold-change graphic currently excluded the unsorted and screen #1 
data because it looks screwy.  I'm not sure what's going on, because it looked 
fine when I collected it, but the data plotted is the only data that looks 
right.
