The idea behind the w11 sensors is to better understand   The design strategy is explained in more detail in the m11 docstring.  I will start by picking a number of designs to test.  Then I'll order them, clone them by inverse PCR, and test them by flow cytometry.  In the end, I'll see if the designs modulate sensor activity in the expected ways.\n"
