In all five structure predictions, the GCCGA from the 5' side of the hairpin is 
base-paired with a UUGGC motif towards the 3' end of the aptamer in the apo 
state, and correctly base-paired with the 3' side of the hairpin in the holo 
state.  According to ViennaRNA, the free energy of this stem is -4.80 kcal/mol:

   $ RNAduplex
   
   Input two sequences (one line each); @ to quit
   ....,....1....,....2....,....3....,....4....,....5....,....6....,....7....,....8
   GCCGA
   UUGGC
   lengths = 5,5
   (((((&)))))   1,5   :   1,5   (-4.80)

In the context of mhf 37, the free energy of this stem is -8.20 kcal/mol, 
although that includes a significant amount of RNA (including another hairpin) 
between the stem:

   $ RNAfold
   
   Input string (upper or lower case); @ to quit
   ....,....1....,....2....,....3....,....4....,....5....,....6....,....7....,....8
   GCCGAUACCAGCCGAAAGGCCCUUGGC
   length = 27
   GCCGAUACCAGCCGAAAGGCCCUUGGC
   (((((.....(((....)))..)))))
    minimum free energy =  -8.20 kcal/mol

It's not clear to me how this hairpin stem affects the function of Cas9.  It 
has no clear effect on the nexus or the ruler.  In the no-spacer case, the 
base-pairing described above allows 3 nucleotides in the ruler to base pair 
with the 3' side of what would be the hairpin, but this pattern is not seen for 
3 of the 4 spacers.

It's possible that there are sequence specific interactions in the hairpin 
itself.  Briner et al. did not make any mutations in the hairpin that would 
reveal sequence-specific interactions (and I think some people just regard the 
hairpin as part of the terminator anyways).  That said, after taking another 
look at the structure, the hairpin in completely solvent exposed.  It would be 
pretty hard to believe that there are specific interactions happening there.

If I wanted to dig into this a little more, I could probably try mutating the 
5' side of the hairpin to see how important the base pairing is.  I could 
probably also mutate the UU in the aptamer, and maybe even the GG if I make 
compensatory mutations on the other side of its stem.  The last C has to stay, 
though, because it's part of the aptamer binding motif.  Still, I could 
strand-swap 4 of the 5 positions, and that might tell me something.
