There are 6 nucleotides in the nexus (GGUGUC) that are complementary to the 
first part of the aptamer (GAUACC).  When there is no ligand present, these 
sequences can form a base-paired stem with no mismatches, only one wobble pair, 
and a GC clamp on either end:

   C=G
   U-A
   G.U
   U-A
   G=C
5' G=C 3'

There are several reasons why this stem could render the sgRNA nonfunctional:

1. The stem sequesters the uracil that flips out and interacts with Cas9 in wt 
   sgRNA.  In mhf/30, the nexus stem comprises three GC base-pairs instead of 
   two, but there's still a uracil just before the 3' side of the stem.

2. The stem effectively moves the first hairpin.  I know from Briner et al.  
   that the spacing between the nexus and the hairpin can be important.  If you 
   regard this decoy stem as the nexus, then the first hairpin is now separated 
   from the nexus by 15 nucleotides, of which 5 are unpaired.  That may be too 
   far.  Alternatively, if you regard the next stem that forms (which comes 
   just one nucleotide after the decoy stem) as the "first hairpin", that may 
   be too close.

3. This stem makes the nexus stem so large that it doesn't fit in Cas9 anymore.  
   This is a little dubious, because the nexus stem is pretty solvent exposed.

According to ViennaRNA, the free energy of this stem is -6.20 kcal/mol:

    $ RNAduplex
    Input two sequences (one line each); @ to quit
    ....,....1....,....2....,....3....,....4....,....5....,....6....,....7....,....8
    GGUGUC
    GAUACC
    lengths = 6,6
    ((((((&))))))   1,6   :   1,6   (-6.20)

However, in the context of mhf/30, its free energy is only -5.70 kcal/mol:

    $ RNAfold
    Input string (upper or lower case); @ to quit
    ....,....1....,....2....,....3....,....4....,....5....,....6....,....7....,....8
    GGUGUCCCGUAUACGCCGAUACC
    length = 23
    GGUGUCCCGUAUACGCCGAUACC
    ((((((.((....))..))))))
     minimum free energy =  -5.70 kcal/mol

For reference, the theophylline aptamer binds theophylline with 320 nM 
affinity, which implies that its folding free energy is -9.21 kcal/mol.  The 
folding free energy of the theophylline aptamer without ligand is:

    $ RNAfold
    Input string (upper or lower case); @ to quit
    ....,....1....,....2....,....3....,....4....,....5....,....6....,....7....,....8
    AUACCAGCCGAAAGGCCCUUGGCAG
    length = 25
    AUACCAGCCGAAAGGCCCUUGGCAG
    ...((((((....)))...)))...
     minimum free energy =  -6.20 kcal/mol

Coincidentally, this is same as the two halves of the decoy stem on their own.  
Especially since the decoy stem is slightly weaker in the context of the sgRNA, 
I suspect that the off-state is delicately balanced between the functional and 
non-functional folds.
