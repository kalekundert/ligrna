    "# Dissolve guanine\n",
    "I realized today that guanine is insoluble in water, so I had to experiment with ways to dissolve it.  In the literature I have on the guanine aptamer, one group suspended it in water and commented that is was not fully dissolved and another dissolved it at 50 mM in 200 mM NaOH.  Online, I found one person reporting dissolving guanine in DMSO to 100 mM."
