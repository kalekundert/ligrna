1. The transcription reactions weren't clean.  Originally I attributed this to 
   old T7, but I saw the same problem with the new T7.  Now I concerned that I 
   either have RNase contamination, or that gBlocks aren't as clean as they 
   used to be.

2. I used the Cas9 that I purified however long ago.  It's been sitting at 
   -20Â°C in glycerol (liquid) the whole time.  It seemed to work fine, though.

3. The mhf 37 in vitro transcription reaction didn't produce as much product as 
   the others, and in the end I didn't get quite enough RNA to make 1500 nM 
   aliquots.  I decided that compensating for this while setting up the 
   reactions would've been too complicated, so the mhf 37 reaction just got 
   slightly less sgRNA.  This may be why mhf 37 seems to turn off so well.

4. These reactions all use 10 mM theophylline, which is 10x more than can be 
   used in vivo.
