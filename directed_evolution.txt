1. Transform pBPK764 (Cas9+CamR) into BW25141 (λDE3) 
   cells already harboring p11-LacY-wtx1 (ccdB+AmpR).

2. Recover in SOC ∓ theo for 1h.

3. Measure transformation efficiency by plating on LB 
   + Carb.  Incubate overnight at 37°C.

4. Select against sgRNAs that cut promiscuously by 
   plating on LB + Chlor + Carb ∓ theo.  Incubate 
   overnight at 37°C.

5. Harvest colonies from the negative selection plate 
   and resuspend them in LB Chlor ± theo.  Incubate 
   at 37°C for 1h.

6. Select against sgRNAs that never cut by plating on 
   LB + Chlor + arabinose ± theo.  Incubate overnight 
   at 37°C.

7. Sequence the surviving colonies.
