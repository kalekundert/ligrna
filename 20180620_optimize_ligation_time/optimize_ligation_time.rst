Optimize ligation time
**********************

I normally do ligations after inverse PCR for 1h, but I got that time from a 
protocol somewhere and was curious if it could be shorter.  To figure this out, 
my plan is basically to do both the 1h protocol and various shorter protocols 
until I'm confident that I know how long the ligation should last for.

Methods
=======
As below, except for varying the length of the ligation reaction.  Since the 
goal is to make this protocol as fast as possible, I used my most abbreviated 
transformation protocol (which is only compatible with Carb-resistant 
plasmids): pre-warm plates (ideally for 1h, but sometimes just for a few 
minutes); thaw competent cells; mix 20 μL cells with 2 μL DNA, pipetting only 
once; immediately heat-shock for 45s; recover on ice for 2 min; spread on 
pre-warmed plates; incubate at 37°C o/n.

Results
=======

It seems like incubation times as short as 15 minutes are fine.
