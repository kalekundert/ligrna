1. Make 1 mL overnight cultures in LB + Carb + Chlor 
   of all 4 sgRNAs (on, off, rxb/11/1, and mhf/30) 
   with all 5 spacers (lz, li, la, lp, lo).

2. Start the day cultures:

   - Prepare 30 mM theophylline dissolved in LB.

   - Prepare media +/− theophylline and +/− IPTG:

     - 59.13 mL LB
     - 62 µL 100 mg/mL carbenicillin (Carb)
     - 62 µL 34 mg/mL chloramphenicol (Chlor)
     - 620 µL 100 µg/mL anhydrotetracycline (aTc)

     - Split into 4 portions: 2x 23.2 mL, 2x 5.8 mL
     - Add to the 23.2 mL portions:
       - 24 µL 1M IPTG
       - 800 µL LB (apo) or 30 mM theophylline (holo)
     - Add to the 5.8 mL portions:
       - 200 µL LB (apo) or 30 mM theophylline (holo)

   - For each construct, inoculate 1 mL apo and holo 
     media with 4 µL overnight culture.

3. Grow at 37°C for 6h (until OD600 reaches 0.5−1.0) 
   [1].

4. Start the β-galactosidase assay:

   - Pellet the cells at 3500g for 10 min at 4°C, 
   - Resuspend in 1 mL PBS [2].

   - Transfer 100 µL of each culture to a black-wall, 
     clear-bottom plate [3].

   - Measure OD600 in the spectrophometer.  Dilute 
     each well with PBS until all are as close to 
     OD600=0.150 as reasonably possible [4].  Record 
     the final OD600 values.

   - Add 100 µL Y-PER (Thermo 75768) to each well and 
     mix well.  Pop any bubbles that form.

   - Incubate at room termperature for 1h [5].

   - Add 100 µL β-galactosidase assay buffer (Thermo 
     75768) to each well.  Pop any bubbles that form, 
     and try to work quickly.

5. Measure A420 every 1 min for 45 min.

Notes
=====
[1] The reaction is not particularly sensitive to how 
    long the cells grow.  In one experiment, I got 
    reasonable data from a saturated overnight 
    culture.  But others claim that the experiment is 
    most robust if the cells are in log-phase.

[2] I'm not sure why, but without transferring the 
    cells to PBS, the A420 trace has a tendency to 
    accelerate upwards slightly after an hour or so.

[3] I don't think it's necessary to use a black-wall 
    clear-bottom plate, but I just wanted to be sure 
    that I wasn't getting any signal from neighboring 
    wells.

[4] If there are too many cells (e.g. OD600 > 0.150), 
    the reaction will exit the linear regime in the 
    ≈10 minutes it takes to setup all the reactions 
    and get the plate in the spectrophotometer.  I 
    haven't tested lower ODs (e.g. 0.100), but I 
    suspect that they might give even cleaner data.

    Furthermore, comparisons between wells with 
    different ODs seem to be inaccurate.  I don't 
    know why this is, because the Miller equation 
    accounts for OD, but I would observe spurious 
    signal in my controls when I didn't dilute them 
    to roughly the same OD.
    
[5] The cell lysis reaction take about an hour to 
    complete, so if the ONPG reagent is added before 
    then, the reaction will accelerate until all the 
    cells are lysed.  This makes it difficult to fit 
    the linear regime, especially for fast reactions 
    that become ONPG-limited and start decelerating 
    shortly after (or even just before) all the cells 
    are lysed.
