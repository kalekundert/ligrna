date: July 26, 2018

1. Make overnight cultures for all strains being 
   tested.

2. Start the day cultures:

   - Prepare 28 mL each of apo and holo media:
  
     - 59.13 mL LB
     - 62 µL 100 mg/mL carbenicillin (Carb)
     - 62 µL 34 mg/mL chloramphenicol (Chlor)
     - 620 µL 100 µg/mL anhydroteracycline (ATc)
     - 62 µL 1M IPTG

     - Split into 2 27.07 mL portions.
     - Add 933.33 µL LB or 30 mM theophylline (in LB) 
       to the apo and holo portions, respectively.

   - For each reaction, inoculate 1 mL media with 4 
     µL overnight culture.  Also prepare 1 mL media 
     with no cells, as a blank.

3. Grow at 37°C until OD600 reaches 0.5−1.0 (~6h30)

4. Start the β-galactosidase assay:

   - Prepare 7500 µL of Working solution (WS):
     - 3750 µL Y-PER
     - 3750 µL 2x β-galactosidase assay buffer.
     - Aliquot 140 µL into PCR strip-tubes.

   - Aliquot 100 µL of each culture into a clear 
     plate.

   - Measure OD600.

   - Add 100 µL WS to each reaction and mix well.

     WS is very soapy, so you need to take care to 
     avoid getting bubbles in the wells.  Reverse 
     pipet to add the WS in the first place, then mix 
     very carefully.  Pop any bubbles with a hot 
     needle.

5. Measure A420 every 5 min for 2h.  

   It's probably unnecessary, but I have the spectro- 
   photometer shake the plate for 20s before each 
   measurement to ensure good mixing.
