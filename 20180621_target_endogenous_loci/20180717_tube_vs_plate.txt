1. Make overnight cultures of lz/on and lz/off.

2. Start the day cultures:

   - Prepare 3 mL LB + Carb + Chlor + 10x ATc + 1 mM 
     IPTG.  Divide between 3 15 mL culture tubes.

   - Inoculate the lz/on and lz/off cultures with 
     4 µL overnight culture.  Leave the last tube as 
     a blank.

3. Grow at 37°C until OD600 reaches 0.5−1.0 (~6h)

4. Start the β-galactosidase assay:

   - Prepare 1.5 mL of Working solution (WS):
     - 750 µL Y-PER
     - 750 µL 2x β-galactosidase assay buffer.

   - Prepare 400 µL of 1x Y-PER
     - 250 µL Y-PER
     - 250 µL water

   - Aliquot each culture for the following purposes:
     - master mix:     400 µL in a tube
     - debris control: 120 µL in a tube
     - od measurement: 100 µL in a plate

   - Measure OD600.

   - Add the following to each reaction:
     - master mix:     400 µL WS
     - debris control: 120 µL 1x Y-PER

   - Start a timer and mix all reactions well.
   
   - Transfer the non-stopped reactions to the plate:
     - master mix:     200 µL (reverse-pipet)
     - debris control: 200 µL (reverse-pipet)
     - Use reverse-pipeting to avoid bubbles.

   - Split the stopped reactions between 3 tubes:
     - master mix: 163.3 µL/tube

5. After 30, 60, and 90 min:

   - Quench one of the stopped reactions for each 
     culture:
        - Add 70 µL stop solution.
        - Note the time and mix well.

   - Centrifuge the stopped reactions at max speed 
     for 5 min.
      
   - Meanwhile, measure A420 for the non-stopped 
     reactions and note the time.

   - Transfer 200 µL (reverse-pipet) of the super-  
     natant of each stopped reaction to the plate.  

   - Measure A420 for the stopped reactions.
