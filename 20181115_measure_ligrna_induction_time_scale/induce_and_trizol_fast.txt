1. Start 1 mL overnight cultures for:
   
   - One ligRNA (e.g. rxb/11/1 or mhf/30): LB + Carb 
     + Chlor
   
   - The "no GFP" control (e.g. wildtype MG1655 
     without GFP/RFP/KanR in the genome): LB + Chlor
   
2. Start day cultures:
   
   - Thaw 50 mL each of apo and holo media.
   
   - Subculture 44 µL of the ligRNA overnight into 
     22 mL apo media and 22 mL holo media.
   
   - Subculture 4 µL of the "no GFP" control into 1 
     mL LB+Chlor.
   
   - Grow at 37°C for 4h30.
     - This is the earliest time (roughly) at which 
       the cultures are thick enough to consistently 
       extract 1 µg RNA.
   
3. Get ready to take timepoints:
   
   - Label 41 1.5 mL tubes (one for each of the 
     conditions listed in the table below).
   
   - Fill 8 columns of a 96-well block with 1.1 mL 
     media in every other row, alternating between 
     apo and holo (2 rows each).  Pre-warm the block 
     to 37°C.
   
   - Prepare a workspace in the fume hood:
     - Wipe surface with ethanol and RNaseZap
     - Benchtop centrifuge
     - 37°C block with at least 40 slots.
     - Tube racks
     - 8-channel P1000
     - Three boxes of P1000 tips, two with tips only 
       in every other row
     - Waste beaker (for media)
     - Waste container (for TRIzol)
   
   - Just before starting the next step:
     - Fill a reservoir with 50 mL TRIzol
   
4. Resuspend the apo and holo day cultures (except 
   the 0:00 timepoint, see table below) in both apo 
   and holo media (4 combinations):
   
   - Pipet 1 mL of each day culture into a properly 
     labeled tube.
   
   - Pellet at 16,000g for 30s.
   
   - Discard supernatant.  One or two sharp downward 
     shakes is usually enough to get the last bit of 
     media out.
   
   - Place the pellets in the 37°C block.
   
   - Start a timer.
   
   - For each timepoint, simultaneously resuspend all 
     4 combinations of ligand conditions using a 
     multichannel pipet.

     - Do the lastest timepoints first and the 
       earliest timepoints last.

     - Aim for 0:30 between each timepoints.

6. Store the cell extracts at 4°C overnight, if you 
   don't want to continue all the way to end.
   
   Finish the RNA extractions.
   
   - Label 41 clean 1.5 mL tubes.
   
   - Add 200 µL chloroform.
   
   - Vortex vigorously.
   
   - Centrifuge for 15 min at 20,000g and 4°C.
   
   - Transfer 400 µL of the aqueous phase (top, not 
     pink) to a clean tube, taking care to not 
     transfer any of the organic phase.
   
7. Concentrate and purify the RNA by ethanol 
   precipitation:
   
   - Add 1 µL GlycoBlue (Invitrogen AM9516) to each 
     sample.
   
   - Add 500 µL isopropanol.
   
   - Incubate at room temperature for 10 min.
   
   - Pellet for 20 min at 12,000g and 4°C.
   
   - Carefully pipet off all supernatant.
   
   - Resuspend pellet in 1 mL 70% EtOH.
   
   - Vortex briefly
   
   - Pellet for 5 min at 7,500g and 4°C.
   
   - Carefully pipet off all supernatant.
   
   - Air dry for 10 min.
   
   - Resuspend RNA in 10 µL water.  
     - Pipet to mix
     - Incubate at 50°C with intermittent gentle 
       vortexing.
   
8. Measure the RNA concentration of each sample using 
   the Nanodrop.  Expected yield: ~300±125 ng/µL.
