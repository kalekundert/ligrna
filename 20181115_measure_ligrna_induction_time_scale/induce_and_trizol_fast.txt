1. Start overnight cultures in 1 mL LB + Carb + Chlor 
   for each construct (on, off, rxb/11/1, mhf/30).

2. Grow each culture with and without theophylline, 
   while inducing Cas9 with aTC (8 total cultures).

   - Subculture 36 µL of each overnight into 10 mL 
     apo media and 9 mL holo media.
 
   - Also subculture 4 µL of wildtype MG1655 (no 
     GFP/RFP) into 1 mL apo media.
 
   - Grow at 37°C for 8h.

3. Get ready to take timepoints:

   - Label 57 1.5 mL tubes (one for each of the 
     conditions listed in the table below).

   - Fill columns 1-12 in a 96-well block with 1.1 mL 
     apo media in rows A+E, and 1.1 mL holo media in 
     rows C+G.  Pre-warm the block to 37°C.

   - Prepare a workspace in the fume hood:

     - Benchtop centrifuge
     - Thermomixer set to 37°C
     - Waste beaker (for media)
     - Container for TRIzol waste
     - 8-channel P1000
     - Three boxes of P1000 tips, two with tips only 
       in every other row
     - Wipe surface with ethanol and RNaseZap

4. Pellet all the day cultures.
  
   - Pipet 1 mL of each culture into a properly 
     labeled tube.

   - Pellet at 16,000g for 30s.

   - Discard supernatant.  One or two sharp downward 
     shakes was usually enough to get the last bit of 
     media out.

5. Process the next set of cultures according to the 
   table below:

   no GFP: wildtype MG1655 (no GFP/RFP)
   controls: on & off, apo→holo & holo→apo
   ligRNAs: rxb/11/1 & mhf/30, apo→holo & holo→apo

   - Place the 4 tubes containing the cell pellets 
     diagonally in the thermomixer (not shaking).

   - Fill 4 tubes (arranged diagonally in a tube 
     rack) with 1.2 mL TRIzol each.  Use 2 mL tubes 
     to allow for faster pipetting.

   - Start a timer.

   - Resuspend each pellet (using the mutlichannel 
     P1000) in media opposite of the kind (e.g.  
     apo/holo) it was grown up in.

   - Move the 4 tubes to the centrifuge.

   - If you have enough time, start the next set of 
     cultures.

   - 1 minute before the desired timepoint:

6. Store the cell extracts at 4°C overnight.

7. Finish the RNA extractions.

   - Label 57 clean 1.5 mL tubes.

   - Add 200 µL chloroform.
 
   - Vortex vigorously.
 
   - Centrifuge for 15 min at 20,000g and 4°C.
 
   - Transfer aqueous phase (top, not pink, ~500 µL) 
     for each sample to a clean tube, taking care to 
     avoid transferring any of the organic phase.

7. Concentrate and purify the RNA by ethanol 
   precipitation:

   - Add 1 µL GlycoBlue (Invitrogen AM9516) to each 
     sample.

   - Add 500 µL isopropanol.

   - Incubate at room temperature for 10 min.

   - Pellet for 20 min at 12,000g and 4°C.

   - Carefully pipet off all supernatant.

   - Resuspend pellet in 1 mL 70% EtOH.

   - Vortex briefly

   - Pellet for 5 min at 7,500g and 4°C.

   - Carefully pipet off all supernatant.

   - Air dry for 10 min.

   - Resuspend RNA in 30 µL water.  

8. Measure the RNA concentration of each sample using 
   the Nanodrop.  Expected yield: ~600±150 ng/µL.
