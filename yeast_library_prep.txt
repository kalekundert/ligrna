Day 2
=====
- Setup a NotI digestion to linearize 80 μg of your 
  library.

  We're doing 10 transformations, and the actual 
  insert is only about half of the plasmid, so this 
  corresponds to 4 μg/rxn.  Benatuil tested insert 
  concentrations from 4 μg/rxn to 16 μg/rxn and found 
  that they all gave similar transformation 
  efficiencies, so we're sticking to the low end of 
  that range.

  Reagent             Conc       Vol
  ──────────────────────────────────
  Water                     to 20 uL
  Plasmid DNA                  80 μg
  CutSmart Buffer      10x      2 μL
  NotI             20 U/μL      2 μL

  - Incubate 1h at 37°C, then 20 min at 65°C, then 
    hold at 12°C.

- Inoculate 400 mL non-caramelized YPD with all of 
  the overnight culture.  The OD should be near 0.3.  
   
- Incubate the cells at 30°C with shaking at 225 rpm 
  in a 1L baffled flask until they reach OD 1.6.  
  This should take about 5h.

- Once the NotI digestion is complete, desalt the DNA 
  using drop dialysis.

  - Fill a petri dish about halfway (~20 mL) with 
    milliQ water.

  - Float a nitrocellulose membrane shiny-side up on 
    the water.  Use tweezers to handle the membrane 
    and make sure no air gets caught underneath it.  

    The reason for having the shiny-side up is 
    explained on the Millipore website.  It's 
    helpful but not crucial, so don't worry if you 
    can't really tell which side is the shiny one:

      Most researchers may not even notice that 
      there is a "sidedness" to filters, and, for 
      most applications, orientation will not affect 
      filter performance.  However, membranes do 
      have a slightly asymmetric pore structure: the 
      shiny side of the membrane is the "tighter" 
      side.  In some applications, you can take 
      advantage of this difference by selecting a 
      specific filter orientation.  Membranes should 
      always be used shiny side up for drop dialysis 
      (a buffer exchange technique in which a few 
      drops of DNA or protein are placed in a 0.05 
      or 0.025 um filter and floated on a buffer 
      solution).  Apply the sample to the shiny side 
      of the filter and float the filter dull side 
      to the buffer.  This measure will enhance 
      buffer exchange and discourage sample loss.  

  - Let the membrane sit for 5 min to allow it to 
    completely soak with water.

  - Pipet the entire NotI digestion reaction (20 uL) 
    onto the center of the membrane.

  - Dialyze for 4h.

  - Pipet the droplet off the membrane and into a 
    clean tube.
   
- Wash the cells with water and "electroporation 
  buffer" once they finish growing:

  - Pellet 3270g, 4°C, 5 min.
  - Resuspend in 50 mL chilled water.

  - Pellet 3270g, 4°C, 5 min.
  - Resuspend in 50 mL chilled water again.

  - Pellet 3270g, 4°C, 5 min.
  - Resuspend in 50 mL "electroporation buffer"
  
- Prepare 20 mL "conditioning buffer":

  Reagent       Conc       Vol
  ────────────────────────────
  milliQ water        to 20 mL
  LiOAc           1M      2 mL
  DTT             1M    200 uL
  
- Resuspend the cells in 20 mL conditioning buffer, 
  then incubate them at 30°C for 30 min with shaking 
  at 225 rpm.

- Prepare 10 mL "recovery media":

  Reagent   Conc   Vol
  ────────────────────
  YPD             5 mL
  sorbitol    1M  5 mL

  - Sterile filter the media using a syringe.
  - Pre-warm the media to 30°C.

- Chill the DNA and 10 electroporation cuvettes (with 
  2 mm gaps).

- Wash the cells with "electroporation buffer" and 
  make aliquots for 10 transformations.

  - Pellet 3270g, 4C, 5 min.
  - Resuspend in 50 mL "electroporation buffer"

  - Pellet 3270g, 4C, 5 min.
  - Add "electroporation buffer" to a final volume 
    of 4 mL.

  - Make 10 400 μL aliquots of cells.
  - Keep on ice.

- Pipet once to mix each aliquot of cells with 2 μL 
  of DNA, then transfer to a chilled cuvette.
    
- Electroporate the cells with the following 
  parameters:

  - Voltage: 2500 V
  - Capacitance: 25 uF
  - Resistance: 200 Ω
  - Gap length: 2 mm

  The Benatuil reference didn't specify a 
  resistance, so I took the 200 Ω parameter from 
  the preset S. cerevisiae protocol on the 
  electroporator.
  
- Immediately suspend the cells in 10 mL "recovery 
  media".  Prepare five 5x serial dilutions to 
  measure transformation efficiency:

  - Dilute 10 uL cells into 40 μL YPD.
  - Plate 20 μL of each dilution.

- Incubate at 30°C for 1h with shaking at 225 rpm.
