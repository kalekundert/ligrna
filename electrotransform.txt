8. Desalt and concentrate the library DNA using a 
   Zymo spin column with the Qiagen buffers:

   - Add 285 μL PB to the ligation reaction.

   - Transfer to a Zymo spin column.

   - Wash with 200 μL PE.

   - Wash with 200 μL PE again.

   - Elute in 10 μL water.

9. Transform the library DNA into Top10 cells by 
   electroporation.  For each transformation:

   - Pre-warm 1 mL SOC and an LB + Carb plate.

   - Chill an electroporation cuvette and 2 μL 
     (≈250 ng) of DNA on ice.  

   - Thaw an aliquot of competent cells on ice for 
     ~10 min.

   - Pipet once to mix the cells with the DNA, then 
     load into the cuvette.  Tap to remove bubbles.

   - Shock at 1.8 kV with a 5 ms decay time (for 
     cuvettes with a 1 mm gap).

   - Immediately add 1 mL pre-warmed SOC.  If you're 
     transforming multiple aliquots of cells with the 
     same DNA, combine them.

   - Before recovering, plate several 10x dilutions 
     of cells (e.g. from 10⁻³ to 10⁻⁶) to count how 
     many were transformed.

   - Recover at 37°C for 1h.
  
   - Transfer cells to 50 mL selective media and 
     grow overnight at 37°C.  Alternatively, plate 
     the cells on enough large plates to fit colonies 
     for each expected transformant.

10. Miniprep to isolate library plasmid.

    - Make a glycerol stock.

    - Miniprep 4 mL of overnight culture.

    - Do a phenol-chloroform extraction on the lysate 
      after pelleting the insoluble cell debris and 
      before loading it onto the miniprep column.  
      This extra step modestly improves transformation 
      efficiency and isn't necessary for libraries 
      with fewer than 11 randomized positions.

    - Elute in 30 μL water.

11. If necessary, combine libraries in proportion to 
    the number of unique members in each.

12. Transform the combined library into MG1655 cells 
    by electroporation.

    - Use the same transformation protocol described
      above.

    - It's best to do the transformation immediately, 
      so as much of the DNA as possible will be 
      supercoiled.  With MG1655 (but not Top10)
      cells, I find that supercoiled DNA gives 100x
      more transformants than relaxed DNA.

13. Store the library as a glycerol stock.

    - 333 μL 80% glycerol, 1 mL overnight culture.

    - Place at -80°C without snap-freezing.
