1. Transform positive and negative control pBPK764 
   (Cas9+sgRNA+CamR) plasmids into BW25141 (λDE3) 
   cells already harboring p11-LacY-wtx1 (ccdB+AmpR).

   - Thaw two 50 μL aliquots of Acella competent 
     cells, one for each target sequence.

   - Mix 25 ng of each control plasmid with 25 μL of 
     competent cells.

   - Rest on ice for 30 min.

   - Heat shock at 42°C for 45 sec.

   - Rest on ice for 2 min.

   - Add 200 μL SOC

   - Recover at 37°C for 1h.

2. Plate the 70 μL of each transformation on:

   - LB + Chlor
     To measure transformation efficiency.

   - LB + Chlor + Carb
     To assess negative selection.

   - LB + Chlor + arabinose
     To assess positive selection.

3. Incubate overnight at 37°C and count colonies in 
   the morning.
