1. Make 1 mL overnight cultures of the designs you 
   want to test.

2. Grow each culture with and without ligand, 
   while inducing Cas9:

   - Subculture 4 μL of each overnight into 1 mL 
     apo media and 1 mL holo media.

   - Grow at 37°C for 9h

3. Dilute 0.5 μL of each culture into 200 μL PBS.

4. Measure the GFP and RFP fluorescence of each 
   culture by flow cytometry.

Below are the excitation and emission maxima for the 
fluorescent proteins used in this assay:

Fluorophore  Excitation  Emission  Reference
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
sfGFP               485       510  Pédelacq (2006)
mRFP                557       592  Campbell (2002)

Below are the laser settings I use on the Lim Lab BD 
LSRII:

Channel  Laser  Filter  Voltage  Threshold
───────────────────────────────────────────
FSC        488              400
SSC        488  488/10      250
GFP        488  530/30      600       5000
RFP        561  610/10      500        500

Below are the loader settings I use on the Lim Lab BD 
LSRII.  I use the lowest flow rate possible because 
my cultures are usually pretty saturated, and I want 
to be as accurate as possible.  I use a relatively 
high sample volume because I want to be sure of 
recording 10,000 events, even for cultures that 
didn't grow well for some reason.  The two 100 μL 
mixes at 180 μL/sec are enough that I don't need to 
mix the cells when diluting them into PBS.  I use the 
highest possible wash volume, but it doesn't help 
anything as far as I can tell.

Loader Setting       Value
──────────────────────────
Flow rate       0.5 μL/sec
Sample volume        60 μL
Mixing volume       100 μL
Mixing speed    180 μL/sec
Num mixes                2
Wash volume         800 μL
