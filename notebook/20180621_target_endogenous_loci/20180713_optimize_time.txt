1. Start overnight cultures of lz/on and lz/off.

2. Thaw 2X β-Galactosidase Assay Buffer on ice.

3. Prepare 3 mL media (EZ + Carb + Chlor + ATC + 1 mM 
   IPTG):

    - Thaw EZ + Carb + Chlor + ATC overnight at 4°C.
    - Add 3 µL 1M IPTG to 3 mL EZ media.
    - Divide between 3 culture tubes.

3. Inoculate each well with 4 µL overnight culture:

4. Measure β-galactosidase activity at 1h intervals, 
   starting at 2h:

    - Transfer 100 µL of each culture to a 
      transparent 96-well assay plate.

    - Determine the OD660 of all test cultures and 
      record values. Include one well that contains 
      growth media only (no cells) as a blank for the 
      spectrophotometer.

    - Mix 200 µL of this assay buffer with an equal 
      volume of Y-PER Reagent to make the working 
      solution (WS). Each well requires 100 µL of the 
      WS, and I have 3 wells (2 controls + 1 blank), 
      so I need 300 µL, plus enough extra for reverse 
      pipeting.  The maximum culture volume allowed 
      per well is 100 µL.

    - Use a timer to monitor the reaction. Apply 100 
      µL of the WS to each well and start timer.

    - Measure the absorbance at 420 nm of each well 
      every minute for 40 minutes.  Record how long 
      it takes to start the start recording data.  
      Use the well containing medium only (no cells) 
      to zero the instrument.
