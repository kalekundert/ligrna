1. Make overnight cultures of lz/on, lz/off, 
   lz/rxb/11/1, and lz/mhf/30.

2. Start the day cultures:

   - Prepare 5 mL each of EZ-theo (apo) and EZ+theo 
     (holo) with 1 mM IPTG.

   - Inoculate 1 mL apo and holo cultures for each 
     strain (8 total).

3. Grow at 37°C for 4h.

4. Start the β-galactosidase assay:

   - Prepare 3 mL of Working solution (WS):
     - 1500 µL Y-PER
     - 1500 µL 2x β-galactosidase assay buffer.

   - Prepare a blank well on a plate by mixing:
     - 100 µL apo lz/on culture
     - 50 µL Y-PER
     - 50 µL water

   - For each culture:
     - Measure OD660
     - Mix 350 µL of the culture with 350 µL WS.
     - Transfer 200 µL to the plate.

5. After 30, 60, and 90 min, for each culture: 

   - Take a 140 µL aliquot.
   - Quench the reaction with 60 µL stop solution.
   - Pellet at max speed for 5 min.
   - Measure A420.
