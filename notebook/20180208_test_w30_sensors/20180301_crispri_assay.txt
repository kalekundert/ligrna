1. Make 1 mL overnight cultures of the designs you 
   want to test.

2. Grow each culture with and without ligand, 
   while inducing Cas9:

   - Subculture 4 μL of each overnight into 1 mL 
     apo media and 1 mL holo media.

   - Grow at 37°C for 8h

3. Dilute 0.5 μL of each culture into 250 μL PBS.

4. Measure the GFP and RFP fluorescence of each 
   culture by flow cytometry.
