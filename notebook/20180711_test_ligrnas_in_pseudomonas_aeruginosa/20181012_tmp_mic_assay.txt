1. Grow 3 mL overnight cultures in LB at 37°C.

2. Grow day cultures to log-phase.

  - Subculture 20 µL into 1 mL Mueller-Hinton (MH) 
    media [1].
  - Incubate at 37°C for 2h.

3. Prepare 4x 1 mM (i.e. 4 mM) theophylline (theo):
  
  - 600 µL 30 mM theo (in MH)
  - 3900 µL MH media

4. Prepare a 4x TMP titration:

  - 2 mL 128 µg/mL TMP in first well.
    - 2 mL MH
    - 4 µL 64 mg/mL TMP
  - 1 mL MH media in remaining wells.
  - Transfer 1 mL on each step.

5. Prepare 2x subcultures:

  - Measure day culture OD.
  - Dilute to OD600 = 2 × 0.0025 = 0.005 [2].
    - Prepare (N+1) mL of diluted subculture for a 
      construct that will be used in N columns.

6. Setup cultures with varying concentrations of TMP 
   and theo in a 96 well plate:

  - Add 50 µL 4x theo or 50 µL apo MH to each well.
  - Add 50 µL 4x TMP titration to each well.
  - Add 100 µL 2x subculture to each well.
  - Add 50 µL mineral oil to seal each well.

7. Record growth curves:
  
  - Incubate at 37°C with continuous shaking for 24h.
  - Measure OD600 every 5 minutes.

Notes
=====
[1] It's important that little thymidine or thymine 
    be present in the media, because the presence of 
    these metabolites would reduce the need for DHFR 
    and therefore the toxicity of TMP.  Therefore 
    it's important to use a MH formulation that's 
    guaranteed to be low these metabolites, which not 
    all are.  I followed the recommendation of 
    [Weigand2008] and used Difco 275730.

[2] The canonical MIC protocol [Wiegand2008] calls 
    for 5×10⁵ CFU/mL in the initial culture.  The 
    proper thing to do would be to plate cells to 
    determine the relationship between OD600 and 
    CFU/mL.  Instead I found Kim2012, which claims 
    that a culture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 
    OD600=1.0 has 2×10⁸ CFU/mL.  If we accept this 
    value, it implies that the our MIC cultures 
    should start at an OD600 of 0.0025.

The volumes in this protocol are enough to fill a 
96-well plate.  As I only have one BSL2 plate reader 
to use, this is as much as I can do at once.
