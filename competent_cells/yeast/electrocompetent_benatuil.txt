Protocol
========
1. Saccharomyces cerevisiae were grown overnight to 
   stationary phase (OD600 of ∼3). 
   
2. An aliquot of the culture was inoculated into 100 
   ml of YPD media (10 g/l yeast nitrogen base, 20 
   g/l peptone and 20 g/l d-(+)-glucose) to reach 
   OD600 of ∼0.3.  
   
3. The cells were grown until OD600 reached ∼1.6 
   before collecting by centrifugation. 
   
4. The cells pellet was washed twice with 50 ml of 
   cold water, and once with 50 ml [cold] 
   electroporation buffer (1 M sorbitol, 1 mM CaCl2).
   
5. Cells were conditioned in 20 ml of 100 mM LiAc/10 
   mM DTT by incubation in culture flask with shaking 
   (225 rpm) for 30 min at 30°C, washed once more 
   time with 50 ml of electroporation buffer, then 
   suspended in 100–200 µl of the same buffer to 
   reach 1 ml volume.  This corresponds to ∼1.6×10⁹ 
   cells/ml.  The scale up of culture and washes 
   volumes should be proportional if more 
   electrocompetent yeast suspension is needed. 
   
6. 100, 200, 300 or 400 µl of cell suspension were 
   used for electroporation per cuvette and 1, 2, 3 
   or 4 µg linearized vector with corresponding 3, 6, 
   9 or 12 µg DNA insert (vector to insert ratio = 
   1:3) were used. 
    
7. Cells were electroporated at 2.5 kV and 25 µF in a 
   BioRad GenePulser cuvette (0.2 cm electrode gap).  
   Typical electroporation time constant ranged from 
   3.0 to 4.5 ms. 
   
8. After electroporation, cells were suspended in 10 
   ml of 1:1 mix of 1 M sorbitol:YPD media and 
   incubated at 30°C for 1h.  
   
9. Finally, the cells were collected and cultured in 
   SD-UT media (-ura, -trp) which contained 20 g/l 
   glucose, 6.7 g/l yeast nitrogen base without amino 
   acids, 5.4 g/l Na2HPO4, 8.6 g/l NaH2PO4·H2O and 5 
   g/l casamino acids.  

10. Number of transformants was determined by plating 
    10-fold serial dilutions of transformed cells at 
    30°C on selective SD-UT plates and counting 
    colonies after 3 days.  The transformation 
    efficiencies (A) were expressed as 
    transformants/µg vector DNA (mean ± standard 
    deviation). The yields (B) were expressed as 
    total number of transformants per cuvette (mean ± 
    standard deviation).
