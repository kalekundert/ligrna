Reagents
========
- 10 mM Tris, 270 mM sucrose, 1 mM MgCl₂, pH 7.5 (EB)

Protocol
========
1. Grow cells at 30°C to a density of 1×10⁷ cells/mL in YPD media.

2. Wash twice with EB (volume not specified)

3. Resuspend in EB to give 5×10⁷ cells in 48 μL.

4. Add 2 μL of DNA to the cells.

5. Pulse

6. Add 1 mL pre-warmed (30°C) YPD directly to the cuvette.

7. Incubate at 30°C for 1h.

8. Plate.
