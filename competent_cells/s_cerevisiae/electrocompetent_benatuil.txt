Reagents
========
- 100 mL YPD
- 120 mL water (chilled)
- 120 mL 1M sorbitol, 1 mM CaCl₂ (electroporation 
  buffer) (chilled)
- 20 mL 100 mM LiOAc, 10 mM DTT (conditioning buffer)
- 10 mL 1:1 mix of 1M sorbitol and YPD media
- 1 SD-Leu plate

- 4 50 mL pipets (chilled)
- 1000 uL tips (chilled)

Reagents
========
- YPD

  - 50.0 g YPD Broth (powder, Fisher BP2469-2)
  - ~900 mL water
  - stir until well dissolved (30 min)
  - sterile filter

  Note that this is "non-caramelized YPD" because 
  it's sterile-filtered rather than autoclaved.  
  Yeast don't grow quite as well in "caramelized 
  YPD", but it might work for this protocol; I 
  haven't tried it.

- electroporation buffer

Day 1
=====
1. Prepare a overnight culture from a fresh colony of 
   the S. cerevisiae strain you want to transform in 
   5 mL YPD.

2. Prepare 120 mL 1M sorbitol:

    - 21.86 g sorbitol (182.17 g/mol)
    - water to 120 mL

3. Reserve 5 mL of the 1M sorbitol, then use the rest 
   to prepare 115 mL "electroporation buffer":

    - 115 mL 1M sorbitol
    - 115 μL 1M CaCl₂
    - sterile filter

4. Put the following reagents and supplies at 4°C:

    - 120 mL milliQ water
    - 115 mL "electroporation buffer" (1M sorbitol, 1 
      mM CaCl₂)
    - 4 50 mL pipets
    - 1 box 1000 μL tips

Protocol
========
1. Inoculate 100 mL YPD 

1. Saccharomyces cerevisiae were grown overnight to 
   stationary phase (OD600 of ∼3). 
   
2. An aliquot of the culture was inoculated into 100 
   ml of YPD media (10 g/l yeast nitrogen base, 20 
   g/l peptone and 20 g/l d-(+)-glucose) to reach 
   OD600 of ∼0.3.  
   
3. The cells were grown until OD600 reached ∼1.6 
   before collecting by centrifugation. 
   
4. The cells pellet was washed twice with 50 ml of 
   cold water, and once with 50 ml [cold] 
   electroporation buffer (1 M sorbitol, 1 mM CaCl2).
   
5. Cells were conditioned in 20 ml of 100 mM LiAc/10 
   mM DTT by incubation in culture flask with shaking 
   (225 rpm) for 30 min at 30°C, washed once more 
   time with 50 ml of electroporation buffer, then 
   suspended in 100–200 µl of the same buffer to 
   reach 1 ml volume.  This corresponds to ∼1.6×10⁹ 
   cells/ml.  The scale up of culture and washes 
   volumes should be proportional if more 
   electrocompetent yeast suspension is needed. 
   
6. 100, 200, 300 or 400 µl of cell suspension were 
   used for electroporation per cuvette and 1, 2, 3 
   or 4 µg linearized vector with corresponding 3, 6, 
   9 or 12 µg DNA insert (vector to insert ratio = 
   1:3) were used. 
    
7. Cells were electroporated at 2.5 kV and 25 µF in a 
   BioRad GenePulser cuvette (0.2 cm electrode gap).  
   Typical electroporation time constant ranged from 
   3.0 to 4.5 ms. 
   
8. After electroporation, cells were suspended in 10 
   ml of 1:1 mix of 1 M sorbitol:YPD media and 
   incubated at 30°C for 1h.  
   
9. Finally, the cells were collected and cultured in 
   SD-UT media (-ura, -trp) which contained 20 g/l 
   glucose, 6.7 g/l yeast nitrogen base without amino 
   acids, 5.4 g/l Na2HPO4, 8.6 g/l NaH2PO4·H2O and 5 
   g/l casamino acids.  

10. Number of transformants was determined by plating 
    10-fold serial dilutions of transformed cells at 
    30°C on selective SD-UT plates and counting 
    colonies after 3 days.  The transformation 
    efficiencies (A) were expressed as 
    transformants/µg vector DNA (mean ± standard 
    deviation). The yields (B) were expressed as 
    total number of transformants per cuvette (mean ± 
    standard deviation).

Notes
=====
- I've only uses non-caramelized YPD for this 
  protocol, but caramelized YPD might work too.
