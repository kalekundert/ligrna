Reagents
========
- 1 mL 2.5M DTT, 1M Tris, pH 8.0 (freshly prepared, 
  room temp)
- 50 mL 10 mM Tris, 270 mM sucrose, 1 mM MgCl2, pH 
  7.5 (E buffer) (room temp)
- 1 mL YPD (room temp)
- 1 selective plate

Protocol
========
This protocol has been adapted from Meilhoc et al. 
[17] and generates enough cells for the 
transformation of ∼60 μg of insert DNA and ∼6 μg of 
vector, which typically produces ∼5×10⁷ yeast 
transformants.

1. Inoculate 100 ml of YPD to OD600 0.1 from a fresh 
   overnight culture of EBY100 (or appropriate yeast 
   strain).

2. Grow cells with vigorous shaking at 30° to an 
   OD600 of 1.3–1.5 (about 6 h).

3. Add 1 ml filter-sterilized 1,4-dithiothreitol 
   (DTT, Mallinckrodt) solution (1 M Tris, pH 8.0, 
   2.5 M DTT). DTT is unstable and the solution must 
   be made fresh just before use. Continue to grow 
   with shaking at 30° for 20 min.

4. Harvest cells at 3500 rpm, 5 min, 4°. Discard 
   supernatant. All centrifugation steps should be 
   carried out in autoclaved centrifuge tubes or in 
   sterile Falcon tubes.

5. Wash with 25 ml of E buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 
   270 mM sucrose, 1 mM MgCl2) at room temperature. 
   Spin down again.

6. Transfer to two 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and 
   wash a second time with 1 ml of E buffer each. 
   Spin down.

7. Resuspend both pellets in E buffer to a final 
   combined volume of 300 μl.  Any extra cells not 
   used immediately may be frozen down in 50-μl 
   aliquots for future use. Note that using frozen 
   cells results in a 3- to 10-fold loss in 
   transformation efficiency.

8. In a microcentrifuge tube, mix 0.5 μl vector 
   (1 μg), 4.5 μl insert (9 μg), and 50 μl 
   electrocompetent yeast cells. Add the mixture to a 
   sterile 0.2-cm electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad).  
   Incubate on ice 5 min. Prepare additional cuvettes 
   until all of the DNA is used.

9. Set gene pulser settings to 25 μF (capacitance) 
   and 0.54 kV (voltage), which gives an electric 
   field strength of 2.7 kV⧸cm with 0.2-cm cuvettes; 
   the time constant should be about 18 ms with 55 μl 
   volumes.  The pulse controller accessory is not 
   used.

10. Carry out pulsing at room temperature. Insert the 
    cuvette into the slide chamber. Push both red 
    buttons simultaneously until a pulsing tone is 
    heard and then release.

11. After pulsing, immediately add 1 ml of room 
    temperature YPD media to the cuvette. Incubate at 
    30° for 1 h in 15-ml round-bottom Falcon tubes 
    with shaking (250 rpm).

12. Spin down cells at 3500 rpm in a microcentrifuge. 
    Resuspend in selective media (SD+CAA,8 
    50 ml⧸electroporation reaction). Plate out serial 
    10-fold dilutions to determine transformation 
    efficiency. The library may be propagated 
    directly in liquid culture without significant 
    bias due to the repression of scFv expression in 
    glucose-containing medium such as SD+CAA.7

Transformation efficiency should be at least 10⁵⧸μg, 
but is typically around 10⁶⧸μg. In addition to the 
electroporation mixture described here, one should 
perform a control where no insert is added and 
determine the transformation efficiency. This is the 
background efficiency and should be less than ∼1% of 
that obtained in the presence of insert DNA.
