Day 1
=====
1. Streak the cells on a fresh plate.

Day 2
=====
1. Grow the cells overnight in 5 mL LB at 37°C with 
   shaking.

2. Place the following items at 4°C overnight:

   - >151 mL 10% glycerol
   - 1 50 mL falcon tube
   - 1 bag 50 mL pipets
   - 1 box 1000 μL pipet tips
   - 1 box 200 μL pipet tips
   - 25 labeled 0.6 mL tubes
   - tube rack

3. Reserve a shaker.

Day 3
=====
1. Inoculate 1L LB with 5 mL overnight culture.

2. Grow at 37°C with shaking at 300 rpm to an OD600 
   of 0.15 (~2h).

3. Place the cells in an ice bath for 10 min to 
   quickly bring them to 4°C.

For the rest of the prep, keep the cells at 4°C.

4. Spin the cells at 3500g for 10 min.

5. Rinse and resuspend each pellet in 50 mL pre- 
   chilled 10% glycerol, then transfer the cells to a 
   30 mL centrifuge tube

6. Spin the cells at 3500g for 10 min.

7. Repeat steps 6 & 7 a second time.

8. Repeat steps 6 & 7 a third time.

9. Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL pre-chilled 10% 
   glycerol.
    
10. Measure the volume of cells, then add more 
    pre-chilled 10% glycerol to bring them to a 
    concentration of 5×10⁹ cells/70 μL, assuming that 
    there are 1.2×10¹¹ cells/L at an OD600 of 0.15.

11. Aliquot 70 μL of the competent cells into ~24 
    tubes.

12. Freeze immediately in N₂ (l) and store at -80°C.
