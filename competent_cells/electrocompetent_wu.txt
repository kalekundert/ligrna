Day 1
=====
1. Streak the cells on a fresh plate.

Day 2
=====
1. Pick a colony and grow it overnight in 20 mL LB.

2. Place the following items at 4°C overnight:

   - 400 mL 10% glycerol (50 mL 80% glycerol, 350 mL 
     milliQ water, sterile filtered)
   - 2 50 mL falcon tubes
   - 1 bag 50 mL pipets
   - 1 box 1000 μL pipet tips
   - 1 box 200 μL pipet tips
   - 30 0.6 mL tubes (autoclaved)
   - 1 tube rack

3. Reserve a shaker.

Day 3
=====
1. Inoculate two 1L LB cultures with 5 mL overnight 
   culture each.

2. Grow at 37°C with shaking at 300 rpm to an OD600 
   of 0.15 (~2h).

3. Place the cells in an ice bath for 10 min to 
   quickly bring them to 4°C.

For the rest of the prep, keep the cells at 4°C.

4. Spin the cells at 3500g for 10 min.

5. Rinse and resuspend each pellet in 50 mL pre- 
   chilled 10% glycerol, then transfer the cells into 
   two 50 mL falcon tubes.

6. Spin the cells at 3500g for 10 min.

7. Repeat steps 6 & 7 a second time.

8. Repeat steps 6 & 7 a third time.

9. Resuspend the cells in enough pre-chilled 10% 
   glycerol to bring their volume to 2700 μL.

10. Make ~30 90 μL aliquots of competent cells.

    This corresponds to 5×10⁹ cells/aliquot, assuming 
    there are 5×10⁸ cells/mL at an OD600 of 1.0.

11. Freeze immediately in N₂ (l) and store at -80°C.
