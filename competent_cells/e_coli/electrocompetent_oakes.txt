1. Begin with the desired strain grown as single 
   colonies on appropriate plates. For example, we 
   use plasmid 44251: pgRNA-bacteria (addgene) with 
   the RFP guide from Qi et al. (2013) transformed 
   and grown on carbenicillin plates (100µg/mL) 
   overnight at 37°C to single colonies.

2. Pick a single colony and inoculate into 5mL SOC 
   (BD Difco 244310: Super Optimal Broth + 20 mL 20% 
   glucose per L) plus carbenicillin. Grow overnight 
   at 37°C.

3. Inoculate 1 L of SOC + carbenicillin with the 5 mL 
   overnight culture. Grow at 37°C for 2–4 hours to 
   an OD 600 between 0.55 and 0.65.

4. Rapidly cool the culture in an ice bath by 
   swirling. Keep cells at during all subsequent 
   steps.

5. Centrifuge cells at 4000g for 10 min. Wash the 
   cell culture with 500 mL ice-cold water by gentle 
   resuspension. Centrifuge at 4000g for 10 min.  
   Repeat wash step twice.

6. Wash cells with 500mL of ice cold 10% glycerol. 
   Repeat twice.

7. Perform a final spin and discard the supernatant. 
   Resuspend the pellet in 2.75 mL of 10% glycerol 
   and aliquot into cold microcentrifuge tubes, 80 µL 
   each. Flash freeze.

8. Transforming cells: Thaw on ice, add library 
   plasmid to 75 µL cells and vortex.
