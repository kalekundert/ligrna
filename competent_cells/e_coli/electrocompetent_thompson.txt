Day 1
=====
1. Make 1L "low salt" SOB:

   - 20g bacto-tryptone (2% w/v final)
   - 5g bacto-yeast extract (0.5% w/v final)
   - 2 mL 5M NaCl (10 mM final)
   - 833.3 μL 3M KCl (2.5 mM final)
   - milliQ water to 1L
   - pH to 7.0 with NaOH
   - autoclave 30 min, 121°C (cycle #5)

2. Reserve a shaker.

3. Place the following items at 4°C overnight:

   - 700 mL milliQ water
   - 240 mL 10% glycerol (30 mL 80% glycerol, milliQ 
     water to 240 mL, sterile filter)
   - 8 50 mL falcon tubes
   - >3 50 mL pipets
   - 1 box 1000 μL pipet tips
   - 1 box 200 μL pipet tips
   - 60 0.6 mL tubes (autoclaved)
   - tube rack

4. Pick a colony and grow overnight in 10 mL SOB at 
   37°C with shaking.

Day 2
=====
1. Inoculate 1L SOB with 1 mL overnight culture.  
   Keep 1 mL to use as a blank.

2. Grow at 37°C with shaking at 225 rpm to an OD600 
   of 0.4 (~4h).

3. Distribute the cells between 4 250 mL centrifuge 
   tubes and balance them.

4. Place the cells in an ice bath for 10 min to 
   quickly bring them to 4°C.

For the rest of the prep, keep the cells at 4°C.

5. Spin the cells at 3500g for 10 min.

6. Rinse and resuspend each pellet in 100 mL 
   pre-chilled water, then distribute the cells 
   between 8 pre-chilled 50 mL falcon tubes.

7. Spin the cells at 3500g for 10 min.

8. Resuspend each pellet in 25 mL pre-chilled water, 
   then consolidate the cells into 4 tubes.

9. Spin the cells at 3500g for 10 min.

10. Resuspend each pellet in 50 mL pre-chilled 10% 
    glycerol.

11. Spin the cells at 3500g for 10 min.

12. Resuspend each pellet in 1 mL pre-chilled 10% 
    glycerol.  The total volume will be ~6 mL.

13. Aliquot 100 μL of the competent cells into ~60 
    tubes.

14. Freeze immediately in N₂ (ℓ) and store at -80°C.
