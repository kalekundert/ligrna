- Pre-warm 1 mL SOC and an LB + Carb plate.

- Chill an electroporation cuvette and 2 μL 
  (≈250 ng) of DNA on ice.  

- Thaw an aliquot of competent cells on ice for 
  ~10 min.

- Pipet once to mix the cells with the DNA, then 
  load into the cuvette.  Tap to remove bubbles.

- Shock at 1.8 kV with a 5 ms decay time (for 
  cuvettes with a 1 mm gap).

- Immediately add 1 mL pre-warmed SOC.  If you're 
  transforming multiple aliquots of cells with the 
  same DNA, combine them.

- Before recovering, plate several 10x dilutions 
  of cells (e.g. from 10⁻³ to 10⁻⁶) to count how 
  many were transformed.

- Recover at 37°C for 1h.

- Transfer cells to 50 mL selective media and 
  grow overnight at 37°C.
