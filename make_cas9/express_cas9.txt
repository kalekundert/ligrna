DNA Endonuclease in Adaptive Bacterial Immunity.  
Science (2012).

Day 1:

1.  Transform pMJ806 (from addgene) into Rosetta2 
    (DE3) pLysS cells for expression.  Select with 25 
    μg/mL Kan (Cas9) and 34 μg/mL Chlor (Rosetta2).

Day 2:

2.  Make a 50 mL overnight culture. Use 2xYT + Kan + 
    Chlor (i.e. the same antibiotic selection as the 
    transformation) and grow at 37°C.

Day 3:

3.  Inoculate 1L 2xYT + Kan + Chlor with 10 mL 
    overnight culture.

4.  Grow the 1L culture at 37°C and 225 rpm until its 
    OD=0.6 (approximately 2 hr).
    
5.  Lower the shaker temperature to 18°C.

6.  Take a 1 mL aliquot of uninduced cells.  Put the 
    aliquot in a culture tube taped to the 1L beaker, 
    so it continues to grow like the induced cells.

7.  Induce expression of Cas9 by adding 200 μL 1M 
    IPTG to each 1L of culture.

8.  Grow overnight (16-24 hr).

Day 4:

9.  Harvest cells by spinning at 2500 rpm (on the 
    Beckmann 9.1 rotor) for 20 min at 4°C.

10. Flash-freeze the cell pellet in liquid N₂ and 
    store at -80°C until ready for purification.
