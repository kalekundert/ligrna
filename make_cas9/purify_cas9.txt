DNA Endonuclease in Adaptive Bacterial Immunity.

1.  Thaw the cells if frozen.

2.  Resuspend the cells in 10 mL lysis buffer (20mM 
    Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 1mM TCEP).

3.  Add one tablet of protease inhibitor cocktail 
    (Roche) to the cell suspension.

4.  Lyse the cells by sonication:
    - 10 sec on, 30 sec off
    - 100 sec total on time
    - 35% tip amplitude

5.  Bind clarified lysate in batch to Ni-NTA agarose 
    (Qiagen).

6.  Wash the bound resin extensively with 20 mM Tris 
    pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl.

7.  Elute Cas9 in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 10% 
    glycerol.

8.  Remove the His6-MBP affinity tag by cleavage with 
    TEV protease, while the protein is dialyzed 
    overnight against 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 
    1 mM TCEP, 10% glycerol.

9.  Separate the cleaved Cas9 from the fusion tag by 
    purifying on a 5 ml SP Sepharose HiTrap column 
    (GE Life Sciences) and eluting with a linear 
    gradient of 100mM-1M KCl.

10. Further purify Cas9 by size exclusion 
    chromatography on a Superdex 200 16/60 column in 
    20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl and 1 mM TCEP.

11. Concentrate the eluted protein to ~8mg/ml, then 
    freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at -80Â°C.
