1. Make 1 mL overnight cultures from recently  
   transformed (within ≈2 weeks) colonies of the 
   sensors you want to test and their corresponding 
   controls.

2. Prepare media with serially diluted ligand.

   - Put 2 mL holo media in the first column of a 96 
     well block.

   - Put 1 mL apo media in the remaining columns of 
     the block.

   - Perform 11 serial dilutions, starting from the 
     first column, transferring 1 mL of media each 
     time.  Leave the last column with apo media.

   - Do the serial dilution for both the sensors and 
     the controls.

3. Inoculate each well with 4 μL overnight culture.

4. Transfer the cultures to a 24 well block.  The 
   improved shaking and aeration is important for 
   getting consistent results.

5. Grow at 37°C with shaking at 225 rpm for 9h.

6. Dilute 0.5 μL of each culture into 250 μL PBS.

7. Measure the GFP and RFP fluorescence of each 
   culture by flow cytometry.
