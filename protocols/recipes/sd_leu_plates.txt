1. Prepare the media in a 1L glass beaker:

   - 6.71 g YNB (Sunrise Science Products, #1501)
   - 690 mg CSM-Leu (Sunrise Science Prod, #1011)
   - 20 g dextrose
   - 20 g agarose
   - 1L water
   - 1 stir bar

2. Autoclave 50 min, 121Â°C (cycle #1).

Note: If making more than 1L, it's best to stick to 
1L bottles.  If you put too much media in a single 
container, it won't heat very quickly and you'll 
probably have to run multiple autoclave cycles to 
melt all the agarose.
