1L SD*
======
- 20.0 g glucose ()
- 6.71 g YNB (Sunrise #...)
- CSM (e.g. 670 mg CSM -His -Leu)

For 1L SDC we do 


100ml 10xCSM

100ml 10xYNB

100ml 20% Glucose

700ml milliq Water


Filter sterilize.  


The information for each of the components is below.  Let me know if you have 
any questions.

KBK: This looks like way to many stock solutions that probably 

10X CSM
=======
Cat #1001-100

Sunrise science products

CSM dropouts 10X:

Andres: Follow instructions on container for 1X, different dropouts require 
different amounts. Scale up to 10X. (it's usually <0.8g/L for 1X so <8g per 
liter ). This takes a long time to dissolve. Be patient and do not autoclave! 
Filter instead.

Sunrise container instructions for 1L says to add 0.79 g/L and autoclave at 
121C

So for 10x, we use 7.9g/L and do not autoclave per andres' instructions (why 
not?)

BMH:  Last time I made 10x CSM, it was over 1h and not dissolving so I turned 
on some heat on the heat plate (up to level 4).  It then dissolved and was 
clear in ~15 min.  

10X YNB
=======
10x Stock (for 1L):

Dissolve 68g YNB in a beaker filled to 800ml with Milliq H20.  Cover and stir 
with heat at level 4 for approximately 25 min or until clear.   The media will 
appear slighly yellow.  In a graduated cylinder add milliq H2O to 1L,  Filter 
into 1L bottle and store in cold room. 

Our YNB is from Sigma:

Reconstitution
--------------
Make a 10x concentrated stock solution by stirring to suspend 6.8g yeast 
nitrogen base powder , 5 g glucose, and 5-10 mg of appropriate amino acid in 
100 mL water. Warm if necessary to aid solubilization. Filter sterilize and 
store at 2-8Â°C.

Dilute the 10x concentrated stock to a 1x working solution by adding 100mL 
concentrated stock to 900mL sterile water.

20% Glucose
===========
For 1 liter of 20% glucose:

Add 200g Glucose (Sigma g7528) to 700ml of milliq water with constant stirring. 
Add the water to the beaker first then sugar! If you are in a hurry you can 
heat the beaker some (not hot, warm) but it should work at room temperature.
