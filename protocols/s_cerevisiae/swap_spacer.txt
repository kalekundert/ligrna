1. Setup the restriction digest of the destination
   vector:

   - 7 μL ≈800 ng/μL pKBK017
   - 1 μL 10x CutSmart buffer
   - 2 μL BsaI-HF

2. Incubate at 37°C for 30 min, then 65°C for 20 min.

3. Gel purify the entire reaction.

4. Setup a zymolase reaction:

   - 46.1 μL water
   - 3.3 μL OD=10 yeast culture
   - 0.6 μL 5 U/μL zymolase

5. Incubate at 37°C for 30 min, then 95°C for 10 min.

6. Setup a 50 μL PCR reaction:

   - 15 μL water
   - 5 μL primer mix
   - 5 μL zymolase reaction
   - 25 μL 2x Q5 master mix

7. Run the PCR reaction:

   - 35 cycles
   - 12s extension time
   - 60°C annealing temperature

8. Do a PCR cleanup and elute in 50 μL water.

9. Setup a Golden Gate reaction:

   - 1.0 μL ≈160 ng/μL pKBK017 (linearized)
   - 25.0 colony PCR product
   - 3.1 μL 10x T4 ligase buffer
   - 1.0 μL T4 ligase
   - 1.0 μL BsaI-HF

10. Run the following thermocycler protocol:

    - 42°C for 5 min
    - 16°C for 5 min
    - 30 cycles

11. Desalt and concentrate the DNA to transform using 
    a Zymo spin column with the Qiagen buffers:

    - Add 285 μL PB to the ligation reaction.

    - Transfer to a Zymo spin column.

    - Wash with 200 μL PE.

    - Wash with 200 μL PE again.

    - Elute in 10 μL water.

12. Transform the DNA into Top10 cells by 
    electroporation.  For each transformation:

    - Pre-warm 1 mL SOC and a selective plate.

    - Chill an electroporation cuvette and 2 μL (≈250 
      ng) of DNA on ice.  

    - Thaw an aliquot of competent cells on ice for 
      ~10 min.

    - Pipet once to mix the cells with the DNA, then 
      load into the cuvette.  Tap to remove bubbles.

    - Shock at 1.8 kV with a 5 ms decay time (for 
      cuvettes with a 1 mm gap).

    - Immediately add 1 mL pre-warmed SOC.  If you're 
      transforming multiple aliquots of cells with 
      the same DNA, combine them.

    - Recover at 37°C for 1h.
  
    - Plate several 10x dilutions of cells (e.g.  
      from 10⁻³ to 10⁻⁶) to count how many were 
      transformed.

    - Transfer cells to 50 mL selective media and 
      grow overnight at 37°C.
