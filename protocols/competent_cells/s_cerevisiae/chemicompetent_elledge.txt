1. Grow the recipient strain of yeast to mid-log 
   (1×107). The better the media used the better the 
   transformation efficiency, so use YPD when 
   possible.

2. Pellet the cells at 2000 rpm in 50 ml aliquots in 
   the Sorvall bench top centrifuge (using 50 ml 
   Falcon® tubes).

3. Resuspend the cells in sterile water; the volume 
   of water used is not important since your only 
   washing the cells. (At this point I usually pool 
   the cells in 2 Falcon® tubes).

4. Repellet the cells as above and then resuspend the 
   pellets in LiTE (100mM LiAc in TE); again, the 
   volume is not critical.

5. Pellet the cells once more and this time resuspend 
   the cells in 5ml of LiSORB for every 200ml of 
   culture (LiSORB is LiTE containing 1M Sorbitol).

6. Incubate the cells for 1h at 30°C with shaking. 
   (Try not to go too long, 1h is optimal 1.5h is 
   dangerous)

7. Pellet the cells as above and decant.; resuspend 
   in 250 µl of Carrier Resuspen-sion Buffer per 
   200ml of culture (CRB is prepared by diluting 20 
   mg/ml carrier DNA in LiSORB to a concentration of 
   4 mg/ml.)

8. After removing 100µl of cells for a negative 
   control, add 2µg of transforming DNA for every 
   100µl of cells remaining.

9. Mix well, then incubate for 30′ at 30°C without 
   shaking.

10. Add 900µl of LiPEG (LiTE containing 40% PEG 3350) 
    for each 100µl of cells and mix well.

11. Divide the cell suspension in Eppendorf™ tubes 
    (≈1ml per tube); this is important because it 
    takes too long a time to heat a large volume of 
    PEG uniformly.

12. Incubate the tubes at 30°C for 20 minutes.

13. Mix the contents of each tube and then heat the 
    tubes (in a heating block) for 10′ at 42°C.

14. Immediately plate the cells or inoculate a second 
    selective media with the cell suspension. Do not 
    try to pellet the cells through the PEG since 
    this will lessen the transformation frequency, 
    and don’t wait too long to plate or grow up the 
    transformants since the PEG is toxic to the 
    cells. 20 μL of cell suspension can give you 
    between 1000-2000 transformants for a healthy 
    yeast strain.
