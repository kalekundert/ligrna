1. Transform pBPK764 (Cas9+CamR) into BW25141 (λDE3) 
   cells already harboring p11-LacY-wtx1 (ccdB+AmpR).

2. Measure transformation efficiency by plating on LB 
   + Chlor.  Incubate overnight at 37°C.

3. Select against sgRNAs that cut promiscuously by 
   plating on LB + Chlor + Carb ∓ theo.  Incubate 
   overnight at 37°C.

4. Harvest colonies from the negative selection plate 
   and give them a chance to cut p11-LacY-wtx1.  This 
   could be done in several ways:

   - Harvest the cells and grow overnight in LB + 
     Chlor.  Mini-prep to purify pBPK764, then 
     re-transform and recover with SOC ± theo.
   
   - Harvest the cells and resuspend them in LB + 
     Chlor ± theo.  Incubate for 1h (to give Cas9 
     time to cut p11-LacY-wtx1) at 20°C (to prevent 
     the cells from growing too much and spitting out  
     p11-LacY-wtx1).

   - Replica plate the cells directly onto the 
     arabinose plate in step 5.

5. Select against sgRNAs that never cut by plating on 
   LB + Chlor + arabinose ± theo.  Incubate overnight 
   at 37°C.

6. Manually pick and sequence the surviving colonies.
