1. Make 1 mL overnight cultures of the designs you 
   want to test.

2. Grow each culture with and without ligand, 
   while inducing Cas9:

   - Subculture 4 μL of each overnight into 1 mL 
     apo media and 1 mL holo media.

   - Grow at 37°C for 8h

3. Dilute 0.5 μL of each culture into 250 μL PBS.

4. Measure the GFP and RFP fluorescence of each 
   culture by flow cytometry.

Below are the excitation and emission maxima for the 
fluorescent proteins used in this assay:

Fluorophore  Excitation  Emission  Reference
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
sfGFP               485       510  Pédelacq (2006)
mRFP                557       592  Campbell (2002)

Below are the laser settings I use on the Lim Lab BD 
LSRII:

Channel  Laser  Filter  Voltage  Threshold
───────────────────────────────────────────
FSC        488              400
SSC        488  488/10      250
GFP        488  530/30      600       5000
RFP        561  610/10      500        500

Below are the loader settings I use for the 96-well 
high-throughput samplers that the Lim and El-Samad 
Labs' BD LSRIIs are equipped with.  I organize my 
plates such that the odd columns contain just PBS 
("wash wells") and the even columns contain the cells 
I want to measure ("sample wells").  This is the only 
way I have found to keep the contamination between 
wells to negligible levels, and I start with a wash 
well in case the user before me didn't clean the 
machine.  I use different loader settings for the two 
types of wells:

Loader Setting     Wash wells  Sample wells
───────────────────────────────────────────
Flow rate          3.0 µL/sec    0.5 µL/sec
Sample volume           30 µL         60 µL
Mixing volume          100 µL        100 µL
Mixing speed       180 µL/sec    180 µL/sec
Num mixes                   2             2
Wash volume            800 µL        800 µL 

For wash wells, I use the highest flow rate possible 
to quickly flush the sample chamber.  For sample 
wells, I use the lowest flow rate possible because my 
cultures are usually pretty saturated, and I want to 
be as accurate as possible.  I use a relatively high 
sample volume because I want to be sure of recording 
10,000 events, even for cultures that didn't grow 
well for some reason (while still leaving enough to 
repeat a plate if necessary).  The two 100 μL mixes 
at 180 μL/sec are enough that I don't need to mix the 
cells when diluting them into PBS.  I use the highest 
possible wash volume, but it doesn't help anything as 
far as I can tell (that why I need wash wells).
