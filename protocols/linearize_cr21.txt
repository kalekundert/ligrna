1. Setup a restriction digest reaction:

    Reagent                Conc      Vol
    ────────────────────────────────────
    pCR21 DNA        ≈500 ng/μL  43.5 μL
    CutSmart buffer         10x   5.0 μL
    XmnI                20 U/μL   1.5 μL

    (approximately 1U XmnI per 1 μg DNA)

2. Incubate at 37°C until no uncleaved plasmid is 
   visible on a gel (1-2h).  Then incubate at 65°C 
   for 20 min to heat-inactivate the enzyme.

3. Purify the DNA using a PCR cleanup kit.  Use a 
   miniprep column to avoid losing too much DNA.  You 
   can also do a gel extraction if you want to be 
   extra sure that the DNA is clean (and you can 
   afford the yield hit).  
   
   If you're doing a large scale prep (e.g. 1 mL), 
   you can't do a PCR cleanup because you'll exceed
   the 10 μg capacity of the spin columns.  Instead, 
   either do an ethanol precipitation.  A miraprep- 
   style PCR cleanup might also work, but I haven't 
   tried it.

4. Measure the concentration on the nanodrop and 
   dilute to 30 nM (80.5 ng/μL for pCR21).
