1. Grow 3 mL overnight cultures in LB at 37°C.

2. Grow day cultures to log-phase.

  - Subculture 20 µL into 1 mL Mueller-Hinton (MH2) 
    media.
  - Incubate at 37°C for 1h.

3. Prepare 4x 1 mM (i.e. 4 mM) theophylline (theo):
  
  - 300 µL 30 mM theo (in MH2)
  - 4200 µL MH2 media

4. Prepare a 4x TMP titration:

  - 2 mL 128 µg/mL TMP in first well.
    - 2 mL MH2
    - 4 µL 64 mg/mL TMP
  - 1 mL MH2 media in remaining wells.
  - Transfer 1 mL on each step.

5. Prepare 2x subcultures:

  - Measure day culture OD.
  - Dilute to OD600 = 2 × 0.05 = 0.10.
    - Prepare (N+1) mL of diluted subculture for a 
      construct that will be used in N columns.

6. Setup cultures with varying concentrations of TMP 
   and theo in a 96 well plate:

  - Add 50 µL 4x theo or 50 µL apo MH2 to each well.
  - Add 50 µL 4x TMP titration to each well.
  - Add 100 µL 2x subculture to each well.

7. Record growth curves:
  
  - Incubate at 37°C with continuous shaking for 24h.
  - Measure OD600 every 5 minutes.

Notes
=====
- The volumes in this protocol are enough to fill a 
  96-well plate.  As I only have one BSL2 plate 
  reader to use, this is as much as I can do at once.
